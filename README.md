# green-sally
Is a python based program intended to be run on boot on raspberry pi. gpio-python is used to toggle the desk between two states configured through files/schedule.

## how to use
run `run.sh` on boot on your raspberry pi. It will have `import RPi.GPIO as GPIO` enabled by default.
So no need for requirements .txt as we have only standard libs.
